# Youtube-Video-Downloader
- Downloads youtube videos and playlists with the option to only download the audio

# How to use
- Simply follow the instructions in the application once you run it

# Config
- You can make the youtube videos download in the background by creating a file called "async.txt" and making the contents "True" 
- Asynchronous is not recommended since when closing the window, it will also close the background downloads

# NOTICE
- Downloading copyrighted videos from youtube.com may get you into problems if you choose to reupload to websites. I am not responsible for any trouble that you get into with this program.
